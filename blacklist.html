<h1>
Intro
</h1>
Hello everyone! You might be wondering as to why I was demoted and blacklisted, I wasn't going to bother making more drama when it's not going to change their minds, but since they blacklisted me I have nothing to lose I guess.
It would mean a lot to me if you spread this post around to your friends to bring awareness.
<h1>Demotion</h1>
This goes back 8 months. In December 2022, I was hosting a giveaway, and asked a Sr.Mod (bene_e) for permission to tell people about my giveaway (posting no invites ofc). I was granted this permission, and I sent a message regarding it. On Jan 2nd 2023, IFlyYT (another Sr.Mod) DMs me and tells me that I should "not post those messages again until further notice", so I didn't. Keep in mind, there has been nothing posted in the rules regarding this so far. A week ago, having totally forgotten the single DM ifly sent me over 7 months ago, I again told people to enter my giveaway. "I'm hosting a giveaway, check my 'about me' for details." Ifly then tells me it's against the rules, and deletes my message. I tell him I totally forgot that he said that. A few days go by, and he permanently bans me and demotes me from YT for "advertising". (not like the entire point of the rank is that they advertise my videos on jartex, and I advertise jartex on my channel) He also removed me from his friends list, so that he wouldn't have to back up his logic. I think it's also worth mentioning that 3 months ago Ifly himself gave me permission to post a 1 minute long video where all I did was talk about my discord, tell people to join my giveaway, with my discord invite in the description. They also currently owe me 48 euros in jartex giftcards which they've 'stolen'.
<h1>Demotion Summary</h1>
Yes, while I did break the rules, I did so in a very minor way and I had reasons to believe that what I did was allowed.
<h1>After My Demotion</h1>
Following my demotion & ban, I resigned from Jartex Team Enhancements. Let me tell you a bit about this sub group since you probably aren't familiar. This is an (official) group of community members that have access to bug reports, and our job is to go through bug reports, gather additional information, figure out if the bug has been fixed or not, and post our findings on ClickUp (basically a TODO website). I resigned from Team Enhancements by posting a message in the discord server, and leaving it. A few days later, I noticed they hadn't removed my access to bug reports on the forums, so, since Ifly removed me from his friends list, I was no longer able to DM him so I found a bug report that HE made, and pinged him telling him to remove my permission to view bug reports, which he did.
<h1>My Blacklist (Pika & Jartex)</h1>
Yesterday, I noticed I still had access to view the ClickUp, so, since I still was unable to contact Ifly, I made a new bug report in which I pinged him and said "remove my access to this, every 10 minutes I will delete one bug report". This was a joke, I never deleted any bugs despite them taking a day to remove my access, and they have confirmed they are aware I haven't deleted anything. JustThiemo saw this and decided that I was deserving of being blacklisted on both jartex and pika (keep in mind, team enhancements has nothing to do with pika). He didn't even give a reason as to why I was blacklisted, Nirahz interrogated him and he ended up giving two reasons: "joking on clickup" and "mass creating pornhub accounts with our emails" (yes, I did this two months ago when I was bored, also I made 2 or 3 accounts, not really "mass creating").
<h1>Final Words</h1>
It's unfortunate. I was the lead designer of several of jartex and pikas biggest updates (I designed most of pika's practice, which after my update went from ~200 players concurrently to peaking at over 600 concurrent players, and jartex's clans update, which people continue to grind to this day), I just think it's very stupid that they decided to blacklist me over this. I knew the Sr.Mods were children (literally, I'm not insulting them) but I expected better from thiemo. I don't think I'll quit youtube, not sure. It would mean a lot to me if you spread this post around to your friends to bring awareness.
<h1>TLDR</h1>
Got demoted from YT for a very minor rule violation. Resigned from Team Enhancements, and got blacklisted for resigning.
It would mean a lot to me if you spread this post around to your friends to bring awareness.
